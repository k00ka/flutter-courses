flutter-courses

A collection of courses taken by the group.

Use the following to pull your own copy:
git clone git@github.com:k00ka/flutter-courses.git

Just to keep things sorted, we ask that you:

1. Add new courses as submodules. They'll need their own repo and you'll need to add each of us as collaborators.
2. Add your personal work to a branch with your own name (in which ever submodule, obvs).

Good luck. And let me know if anything needs to change.
